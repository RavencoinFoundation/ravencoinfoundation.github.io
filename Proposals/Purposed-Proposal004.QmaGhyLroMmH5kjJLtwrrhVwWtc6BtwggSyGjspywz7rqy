The ability[and Qt GUI] to modify an asset so that a second gas fee may be tied to each time a non Asset! is transferred.

With the option for the gas price to increase by X% with a compound, no compound switch.  
This ability should have a lock or leave unlocked option like when changing the ipfs of main assets and subassets, with all data points able to be seen on chain. 

Obviously on the wallet with the Asset! should be able to utilize the functionality.
