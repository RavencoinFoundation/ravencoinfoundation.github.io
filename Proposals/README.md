# Proposals

Add proposals with a filename format of
[Display name].[IPFS content identifier].txt

You can add a description in the file that may be used in the future, but currently unused.

Anyone can create a proposal, and suggest that it get funded. Because it is being placed on the Ravencoin Foundation website, the proposal will be evaluated before inclusion in the same manner that a PR would be evaluated before acceptance.  Use pull request for your proposal.  Other options like [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) are also available to you.
